Context: Using the American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau, we wish to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether an individual is employed (target variable). The individuals in the selected cohort are of ages between 16 and 90 and have a PUMS person weight of at least 1. The dataset contains a total of 281 features (e.g., age, workclass, health insurance plan). As an initial step prior to training the model, we first want to identify a subset of the 281 features that are most important for reliable prediction of the target variable.
