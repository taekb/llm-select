Context: Using the American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau, we wish to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether an individual has an income greater than $50,000 (target variable). The individuals in the selected cohort are of ages above 16, have worked at least 1 hour per week in the past year, have an income of at least $100, and a PUMS person weight of at least 1. The dataset contains a total of 281 features (e.g., age, workclass, health insurance plan). Prior to training the model, we first want to identify a subset of the 281 features that are most important for reliable prediction of the target variable.
