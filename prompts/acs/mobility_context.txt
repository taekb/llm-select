Context: Using the American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau, we wish to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a young-adult individual moved residential addresses in the past year. The individuals in the selected cohort are of ages between 18 and 35. The dataset contains a total of 281 features (e.g., age, workclass, health insurance plan). Prior to training the model, we first want to identify a subset of the 281 features that are most important for reliable prediction of the target variable.
