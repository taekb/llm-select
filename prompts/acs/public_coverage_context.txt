Context: Using the American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau, we wish to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a low-income individual has coverage from public health insurance (target variable). The individuals in the selected cohort are of ages below 65 (not eligible for Medicare) and have a total income less than $30,000. The dataset contains a total of 281 features (e.g., age, workclass, employment status). Prior to training the model, we first want to identify a subset of the 281 features that are most important for reliable prediction of the target variable.
