Context: Using data collected via a telemarketing campaign at a Portuguese banking institution from 2008 to 2013, we wish to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (target variable). The dataset contains a total of 16 features (e.g., age, marital status, whether the client has a housing loan). Prior to training the model, we first want to identify a subset of the 16 features that are most important for reliable prediction of the target variable.
