Context: Using 1990 U.S. Census data, we wish to build a machine learning model that can predict the median housing price for each block group in the census (target variable). A block group, typically with a population of 600 to 3,000 people, is the smallest geographical unit for which the U.S. Census Bureau publishes sample data. The dataset contains a total of 8 numerical features (e.g., average number of rooms for houses in the block group, latitude and longitude of the block group), and each sample in the dataset corresponds to a block group. Prior to training the model, we first want to identify a subset of the 8 features that are most important for reliable prediction of the target variable.
