Context: Using data from a 2016 study on the use of the Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) algorithm, we wish to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a criminal defendant carries high risk for recidivism (target variable). The individuals in the study cohort are from Broward County, Florida and were assigned COMPAS risk scores in 2013 and 2014. The dataset contains a total of 13 features, including criminal history and demographics. Prior to training the model, we first want to identify a subset of the 13 features that are most important for reliable prediction of the target variable.
