Context: Using data collected at a German bank, we wish to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a client carries high or low credit risk (target variable). The dataset contains a total of 20 features (e.g., credit history, savings account status). Prior to training the model, we first want to identify a subset of the 20 features that are most important for reliable prediction of the target variable.
