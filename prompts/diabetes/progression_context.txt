Context: We wish to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict disease progression in diabetic patients (target variable), given their baseline blood serum measurements from the previous year and demographics. We measured a total of 10 clinical features (e.g., blood sugar level, cholesterol level, age, sex). Prior to training the model, we first want to identify a subset of the 10 features that are most clinically important for reliable prediction of the target variable.
