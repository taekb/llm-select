Context: We wish to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether an individual is likely to experience serioues financial distress in the next two years (target variable). The dataset contains a total of 10 features (e.g., debt ratio, monthly income). Prior to training the model, we first want to identify a subset of the 10 features that are most important for reliable prediction of the target variable.
