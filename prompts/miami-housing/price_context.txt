Context: Using data collected on 13,932 single-family homes sold in Miami in 2016, we wish to build a machine learning model that can predict the selling price of each house (target variable). The dataset contains a total of 15 features, which include structural (e.g., area, structure quality) and geographic (e.g., longitude, latitude) information about each house. Prior to training the model, we first want to identify a subset of the 15 features that are most important for reliable prediction of the target variable.
