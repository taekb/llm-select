Context: Using retrospective electronic health record time-series data, we wish to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a patient in the intensive care unit (ICU) will develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) (target variable). We extracted a total of 148 clinical features, which include lab test results (e.g., creatinine, lactate levels in the blood), bedside physiological measurements (e.g., heart rate, arterial blood pressure), nurse assessments (e.g., Braden scale, pain assessment), patient medication information (e.g., vasopressor administration), and demographics (e.g., ethnicity, sex), recorded during the first 24 hours of each patient's stay in the ICU. Prior to training the model, we first want to identify a subset of the 148 features that are most clinically important for reliable prediction of the target variable.
