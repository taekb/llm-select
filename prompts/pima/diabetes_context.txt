Context: We wish to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a patient has diabetes (target variable), given several diagnostic measurements. The selected individuals in the cohort are female patients of Pima Indian heritage who are at least 21 years old. We measured a total of 8 clinical features (e.g., blood pressure, insulin). Prior to training the model, we first want to identify a subset of the 8 features that are most clinically important for reliable prediction of the target variable.
