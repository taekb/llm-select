Context: Using various physicochemical measurements made on red and white vinho verde wine samples from northern Portugal, we wish to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a wine is high or low quality (target variable). The dataset contains a total of 11 features (e.g., acidity, density, sugar content). Prior to training the model, we first want to identify a subset of the 11 features that are most important for reliable prediction of the target variable.
